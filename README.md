# Music_Therapist

• Developed a fully functional music app in Android Studio using Java, Android Programming and Pervasive Programming, aimed at providing a therapeutic listening experience for users; this was a team task, and I took charge from project initiation to coding and implementation.

• Achievements: integrated Firebase for login and account management; implemented theme and background selection options; incorporated a song suggestion system based on LFU algorithm; enabled local music storage; uploaded a video tutorial page to assist users.

• Special features: leveraged motion sensors including an accelerometer, gyroscope, and step counter to
automatically change songs based on user motion.
